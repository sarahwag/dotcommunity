**We won't be talking directly about Social Justice Dogma (SJD) in this Module**. Instead, we're laying the groundwork necessary for us, and you, to do so.

So we want to give you a release valve first, because if SJD wasn't on your mind, you probably wouldn't be in this course (right?).

Reply with your current feelings about SJD, get everything off your chest, then do your best to keep all of that in mind as we explore the idea of community.
